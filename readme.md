Comparison of the proposed deal of 12/03/2018 compared to previous arrangements
===============================================================================

Richard Wilkinson has published a [calculation](rich-d-wilkinson.github.io/PensionsCap/html) of the effect
of the proposed CPI cap on our pensions. I wanted to know what the difference from now was, so this is that
attempt. I indend to publish at iansudbery.github.io/PensionsCap2.html.

Any and all additions, forks, PRs more than welcome, lets work this out together.

In paritcular it could do with:

* a model for realistic salary progression. 

* A consideration of what the DC pot might look like above the threshold. 

* A consideration of if using the last 40 years as a guide to CPI is a
  good idea.
